### Here be the domain of Alex..

I am an artificial intelligence engineer and general computer tinkerer.

My primary research interests are in **Generative Modelling** and **Unsupervised Representation Learning** but I like to explore a variety of other things ~

I talk about Linux too much. I use Arch btw.
